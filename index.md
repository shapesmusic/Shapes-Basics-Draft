### Skill Sets:

<strong style="color: purple;">Playing With Songs</strong>

[Level 1](levels/01-a-shape) introduces a shape. [Level 2](levels/02-different-shapes) and [3](levels/03-a-group) expand to a full group of shapes and give them names. [Level 6](levels/06-playing-with-the-anchor) introduces the anchor note as a way to structure what you play. [Level 8](levels/08-matching-a-shape) shows you how to figure out the shape on your own. [Level 9](levels/09-notes-in-time) introduces music notation. And [Level 11](levels/11-groups-of-shapes) introduces three additional groups of shapes that will occasionally show up in songs.

<strong style="color: blue;">Tactile Reading</strong>

[Level 4](levels/04-shape-fingerings) introduces a single fingering pattern that allows you to play hands together in any shape, starting on any note. [Level 12](levels/12-reading-by-touch) uses this pattern to begin reading a relative notation along with songs, in a way that feels like playing a rhythm game. [Level 18](levels/18-reading-by-touch-2) and [23](levels/23-reading-by-touch-3) expand the range of shapes and add features to the notation. [Level 27](levels/27-making-time-relative) replaces pulse dots with rhythmic note symbols. And [Level 30](levels/30-incidentals) gives a way to notate outside the shape.

<strong style="color: red;">Chord & Key Levels</strong>

[Level 5](levels/05-the-anchor-note) introduces the anchor note as a way of structuring the other notes of the shape. [Level 7](levels/07-bass-notes) shows that changing bass notes along with any other notes of a shape creates the recognizable framework for a song. And [Level 10](levels/10-changes) introduces changing shapes, anchors, and bass notes.

<strong style="color: green;">Tonescapes & Tensions</strong> (audio)

[Level 13](levels/13-a-tonescape-and-tensions) introduces a tonescape, and recognition of the anchor, one note higher, and one note lower within the tonescape. [Level 15](levels/15-two-higher-and-lower) expands to two notes higher and lower. [Level 17](levels/17-switch-to-number-names) brings in octave equivalence and switches from higher/lower names to number names. [Level 19](levels/19-moods) and [21](levels/21-light-and-heavy-tensions) introduce different moods that result from the sum of tensions to the anchor. [Level 24](levels/24-moods-and-tensions-together), [25](levels/25-getting-inside-of-moods), and [28](levels/28-all-moods-and-tensions) expand to recognition of all moods and all tensions. And [Level 31](levels/31-independent-solfege) removes the tonescape.

<strong style="color: orange;">Reading Imagery</strong> (audio)

[Level 14](levels/14-imagination-as-an-instrument) introduces imagery. [Level 16](levels/16-reading-by-ear) uses notation to draw two additional notes out of the tonescape. [Level 20](levels/20-reading-by-ear-2) expands to three moods. [Level 22](levels/22-reading-by-ear-3), [26](levels/26-reading-by-ear-4), and [29](levels/29-mood-notes) expand to hearing all tensions in all moods. And [Level 32](levels/32-free-play) is free play imagery in all moods.
