### Transcript

Now that you can recognize the notes two higher and two lower, you're ready to start drawing these notes out of the tonescape without hearing them first.

But rather than practicing with a recording, we're going to start reading the notes from music notation. 

And since you can already recognize the tensions, you don't need the recording to tell you if you're imagining the right note. Instead, you can listen to that note in your mind's ear, or hum it at first if you need to, and check for yourself if you've got it right.

So turn on the tonescape [tonescape starts], and then there are two different notations that give you notes to hear *inside* the tonescape. Let's take a look at those.

[show first line of each notation]

Both notations place the anchor on the middle line of the staff, and both begin with the anchor. But in the first notation, each note is only one note higher or lower than the previous note. And in the second notation, the notes are in random order&mdash;any note can follow any other note.

You might find the first notation a little easier to begin with, because you're always finding the next note higher or lower than the note you just heard, like this:

[demo]

But as you move between the notes, be careful to really keep *yourself* positioned at the anchor, and to feel each new note as a tension that wants to pull back to the anchor. 

Moving between the notes in this way will set you up for the second notation, because to hear a random note inside the tonescape, you want to develop a feeling for how many notes higher or lower it is than the anchor.

To practice, start at the anchor, then move through each note between the anchor and the note that's written. Then when you reach the note that's written, feel it as a tension that many notes higher or lower than the anchor, and then work your way back to the anchor, like this:

[demo]

Take as much time as you need to do this. Before long, you'll be able to jump right to each new note and feel it as a tension to the anchor, without having to step through the notes in between, like this:

[demo]

Remember that it's okay to hum the notes you read at first, but you also want to practice hearing each note in the tonescape, *without* humming it.

When you start to get the hang of this, it'll feel like reading a book quietly to yourself. You're building an instrument in your mind's ear, that you can use as you're reading, or writing, or listening, or playing a real instrument. You're developing musical fluency.

So give it a try. And when you've gotten the hang of hearing both notations inside the tonescape, that's when you're ready to come back for more.
